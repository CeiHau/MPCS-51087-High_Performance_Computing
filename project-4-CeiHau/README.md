# Project 4
I chose the ML part

Curve Fit and Higher Language Part for neural network are in the ```milestone1``` foler.

C/C++ language version neural network in the ```C++version``` folder. <br>
I write a serial version with C++, which I spent a lot of time on it, but for CUDA there is still something wrong with my code. I am sorry that I don't have enough time to finish it. I regret choosing the ML part, I should have chosen the N Body problem....
